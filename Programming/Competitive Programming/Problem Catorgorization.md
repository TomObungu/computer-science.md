# Easy 
The problem is solved **intuitively without needing to make notes or induce any form of external visualization**. In these cases, the drawbacks are often from minor syntax / semantic errors and the occasional logic error in implementation. However the overall problem is feasible and the time taken to form an acceptable structured approach to the problem is relatively short. 

Easy challenge rating problems are best for increasing skill in implementation, intuition and speed. 

# Medium 
The problem is solved, however required additional time to process the problem and t**he use of note taking or external visualization e.g. a sheet of paper** in order to make it easier to solve. In these cases, the drawback is the time taken to process and understand the problem and come to conclusion of a structured approach of the problem. Once a structured approach has been found the implementation of the problem may also prove challenging. However, the problem is able to be solved despite increased time. 

Mediumly challenging problems are the best for growth of skill in problem solving, and overall rating.

# Hard
The problem is solved with prolonged time spent on processing the problem and solutioning. **The use of debugging whilst implementation, note taking and methods to visualize and abstract the problem** are all needed in order to come to structured approach and/or implement a working solution. Such problems often take a lot of critical thinking and and/or repeated thought trails to come to a structured approach. As well as that the implementation may be complicated and/or tedious to implement.

Such problems are good for challenging yourself in a competent topic or trying to promote growth in a weak topic. Generally hard problems should be attempted when trying to improve in a certain topic without considering rating. Hard problems may or may not promote skill in implementation however hard problems will add to problem solving experience.
